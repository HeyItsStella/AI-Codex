# Quick Analysis

## Q1 How much do students trust programming AI?

- The output the system produces is as good as that which a highly competent person could produce.
- I know what will happen the next time I use the system because I understand how it behaves.
- I believe the output of the the system even when I don't know for certain that it is correct.
- I have a personal preference for using such AI systems for my tasks.
- Overall, I trust the AI system I use.

There are 2 sets of these questions in the survey. The phrasing is slightly different, such that we can extrapolate trust from the non-usage group.

- Distrust:  43
- Neutral:  25
- Trust:  59
- Total:  127
- Distrust%: 0.33858267716535434
- Neutral%: 0.1968503937007874
- Trust %:  0.4645669291338583

Extrapolated from the mean of those 5 questions.
If the mean was:

- `< 3` - distrust
- `== 3` - neutral
- `> 3` - trust

## Q2 How do students perceive programming AI as helping or hurting them when learning programming?

- Using AI helps me complete programming tasks.
- Using AI helps me when I am stuck while solving programming tasks.
- Using AI helps improve my knowledge about programming concepts.
- Using AI makes me feel more confident about programming.
- Overall, using AI has improved my motivation and engagement in programming/CS.

Since this is a question aimed towards only those who have used AI. These questions are only concerning those who have used AI.

## Q3 How do students perceive programming AI tools (overall positive/negative, skeptical, fear of losing jobs, etc.)?

- I have been encouraged to use AI tools.
- Professionals use AI tools for programming tasks
- Other people I know are using AI tools for programming tasks
- I worry that AI is going to replace programmers.
- I feel less like a real programmer when I use AI systems for programming. (Only for those who have used)

This question is perfect for going through the open ended responses to see if there are any specific responses.

`Probably would be better to use some bar/count plots instead, but I ran out of time.`

## Q4 How do students perceive their own programming abilities, given their extensive use of AI (or not)?

- I feel confident completing programming assignments by myself.
- I feel confident completing programming assignments when I am working with someone else (e.g., classmate).
- I feel confident completing programming projects when I have someone to seek help from (e.g., tutor).
- I feel confident finding the steps to solve a programming assignment.
- I feel confident finding ways out when I am stuck on a programming problem.

Compared with whether they use AI or not.

Might be worth including the question `I worry that AI is going to replace programmers.`
